# Algorithm Analysis and Design Project - TCP2101

## Overview

This project, part of the TCP2101 course, involves an in-depth analysis and implementation of various algorithms. 
The team focused on Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, and the Knapsack algorithm, applying these to practical computing and data analysis challenges.

## Algorithms

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Pathfinding in graphs.
- **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: Minimum spanning tree.
- **Heap Sort & Merge Sort**: Efficient sorting methods.
- **Knapsack Algorithm**: Dynamic programming approach for value optimization.

## Requirements

- **C++**: C++ compiler
- **Software for Graph.ipynb**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: [List of Python libraries used, e.g., numpy, matplotlib]

## Dataset

- The dataset is stored in the folder called DatasetsSample.

## Output
